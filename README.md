# Requester

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/dogukanayd/requester/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/dogukanayd/requester?branch=main)

Request is a HTTP request library for Go with interfaces and mocks for unit tests.


The reason for having this package is using the interfaces to mock the HTTP requests easily on the codebase. Before
creating this repository I was copying and pasting this package to my projects. So I decided to move this package to the
separated package from my projects and use it with all of my projects.
